//Question: 83. Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method
//calculateArea(). Implement two subclasses: Circle and
//Square. Each subclass should have relevant attributes (like
//radius for Circle, side for Square) and their own
//implementation of the calculateArea() method.

    public abstract void calculateArea();
}
